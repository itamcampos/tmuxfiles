# By default, tmux loads the system configuration file
# from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then looks for a user
# configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf.
#
# The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which
# are executed in sequence when the server is first started.
#
# tmux loads configuration files once when the server
# process has started.
#
# The source-file command may be used to load a file later.
#
# tmux shows any error messages from commands in
# configuration files in the first session created, and
# continues to process the rest of the configuration file.
